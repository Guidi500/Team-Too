<h2> Lyrics </h2>


<p> 
    <br>I'll be the spark, if you'll be the flame
    <br>Start a reaction that can't be contained
    <br>Balance your pH by sharing my base
    <br>I'll be your star, if you'll be my space
    <br>
    <br>'Cause there is no distance that I wouldn't go
    <br>Through spacetime and wormholes my matter would flow
    <br>To the edge of the universe
    <br>
    <br>I'll be your G, if you will be C
    <br>Or I can be A, if you will be T
    <br>If there's a mutation I'll fix every base
    <br>Working as your zinc finger nuclease
    <br>
    <br>Just like an atom, don't rip us apart
    <br>Unless you want a big BOOM in my heart
    <br>
    <br>We can take it fast or really slow
    <br>But we can't know with certainty where we'll go
    <br>If at first we don't succeed, we'll try two more times
    <br>So our failure's a statistically significant try
    <br>
    <br>Like an equation, it all works out
    <br>If we balance the sides there's no need to doubt
    <br>
    <br>CHORUS:
    <br>This is your science love song
    <br>A place to start our chemical bond
    <br>A research endeavour
    <br>We can write the conclusion together
    <br>
    <br>Just like the movies I'd steal your heart
    <br>But then you'd die...so I won't do that
    <br>
    <br>If we broke up I'd be no more
    <br>I'd give up H2O for H2SO4
    <br>Take away gravity, I'd still fall for you
    <br>Share my last electron in a covalent bond for two
    <br>
    <br>'Cause you're like that angle, A-cute and you're smart
    <br>Your labcoat and goggles go straight to my heart
    <br>Except that's a lie, cause the heart doesn't feel
    <br>When it comes to love the brain seals the deal
    <br>
    <br>REPEAT CHORUS
    <br>This is your science love song
    <br>A place to start our chemical bond
    <br>A research endeavour
    <br>We can write the conclusion together
    <br>
    <br>'Cause you matter to me
