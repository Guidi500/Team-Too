<h2> Lyrics </h2>

<p> 
    <br>The electromagnetic spectrum us just a name of a range of radiation
    <br>Let me tell you what they are
    <br>Radiowaves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible waves, ultra violet, x-ray, gamma waves!
    <br>
    <br>From the TV station to your living room.
    <br>That is the work of radio waves
    <br>Heating food in just seconds
    <br>Microwaves do that
    <br>Heat treatment for illness
    <br>Take pictures in the dark
    <br>They are even in your remote control: infrared radiation!
    <br>
    <br>The electromagnetic spectrum us just a name of a range of radiation
    <br>Let me tell you what they are
    <br>Radiowaves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible waves, ultra violet, x-ray, gamma waves
    <br>
    <br>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
    <br>That is the only part of the spectrum that can be seen by us
    <br>The suntan on your skin
    <br>Kill bacteria and viruses
    <br>Use to detect forgery
    <br>That is ultra violet!
    <br>
    <br>The electromagnetic spectrum us just a name of a range of radiation
    <br>Let me tell you what they are
    <br>Radiowaves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible waves, ultra violet, x-ray, gamma waves
    <br>
    <br>See broken bones and hidden bombs
    <br>That is the work of x-rays!
    <br>Kill cancer cells and steralise
    <br>Dangerous gamma rays to that!
    <br>
    <br>Now we have completed the electromagnetic spectrum
    <br>If you still do not understand, then play this video again!
    <br>
    <br>The electromagnetic spectrum us just a name of a range of radiation
    <br>Let me tell you what they are
    <br>Radiowaves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible waves, ultra violet, x-ray, gamma waves
    <br>
    <br>The electromagnetic spectrum us just a name of a range of radiation
    <br>Let me tell you what they are
    <br>Radiowaves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible waves, ultra violet, x-ray, gamma waves
