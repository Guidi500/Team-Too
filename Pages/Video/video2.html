<p> 
    
    <br> Welcome to Science WARS!
    <br> Chemistry-Bio-Physics-Mathematical
    <br> But which field is best?
    <br>
    <br> PHYSICS:
    <br>
    <br>I understand the force and energy
    <br>Quantum mechanics and relativity
    <br>My field is pure and they rely on me
    <br>I see the universe like nobody
    <br>
    <br>You may have made fun of me in high school
    <br>For being awkward and following the rules
    <br>Now I’ve got laser (WOW, That’s really cool) 
    <br>May the mass times acceleration be you 
    <br>
    <br>Atoms-Entropy-Dark Matter-String Theory
    <br>
    <br>CHEMISTRY:
    <br>
    <br>If you want to feel a bond
    <br>Then I can give you a good reaction
    <br>The elements that make up life 
    <br>Are my essence, are my satisfaction 
    <br>
    <br>All the other fields out there are so basic
    <br>Yeah, I’m the central science
    <br>Keep your eye on me
    <br>I’ll get you charged
    <br>
    <br>If you need me, call me up on
    <br>Avogadro's Number
    <br>If you leave me, take a titrant 
    <br>Shove it up your acid buffer
    <br>
    <br>Dopamine and serotonin
    <br>Will keep you good and happy 
    <br>So get your flask and your glass all set up
    <br>And begin to understand the world!
    <br>
    <br>BIO:
    <br>
    <br>Within me you’ll find life’s beauty
    <br>In genetics and ecology
    <br>Symbiosis and not division
    <br>Unless it’s mitosis or the study of fission
    <br>
    <br>Even if you don’t pass, at least you’ll enjoy my class!
    <br>
    <br>Evolution, has brung us along
    <br>All species singing one song
    <br>
    <br>MATH:
    <br>
    <br>If you want to learn about the world I must say
    <br>I am the purest field of study you can take
    <br>Immune to misinterpretation
    <br>The blueprint of creation 
    <br>The backbone of all things science
    <br>
    <br>No bias, just constant augmentation
    <br>In your mind, and observation
    <br>No gadgets, just your logic and your time
    <br>
    <br>And PIE
    <br>
    <br>ENDING:
    <br>
    <br>Together we will find the answers to life!
    <br>With physics-bio-chemistry-and math
    <br>We can...SCIENCE!
